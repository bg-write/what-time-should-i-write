	<p>
		I aim to be as
		accurate as possible, only sharing routines that writers have talked about
		on record. Sometimes writers have multiple routines. Sometimes they change
		their routines over the years. Some are super detailed. Others are vague and
		are more guidelines than routines. I tried my best to present each writer
		approach to creativity in an informative way while staying as true to how
		their worked.

	<p>
		I'm constantly adding new writers and updating this database when I can.

<div>
	<p>
		Are there any writers who you want me to add to this database?
